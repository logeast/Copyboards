Copyboards is a searchable clipboard history application for copy and paste. It is written in [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/), [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

With Copyboards, you don't worry about text, images and file links you've copied but forget to paste earlier. It's all there in your searchable history.
