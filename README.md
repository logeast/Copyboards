![Copyboards Logo](./website/public/copyboards-mini.svg)

A searchable clipboard history application for copy and paste, inspired by [Alfred Clipboard History](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/clipboard), build with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

With Copyboards, you don't worry about text, images and file links you've copied but forget to paste earlier. It's all there in your searchable history.
